# 🪙 Coinflip

A small, fast C program that simulates flipping a coin in your terminal.

## 📦 Build

To build the program:

`make`


This will compile the code and output the binary to the `build/` directory.

## 🚀 Run

You can flip a coin like so:

`./build/coinflip`


Output will be either `Heads` or `Tails`.

Made for fun and practice. No actual coins were harmed in the making of this program.

## ❓ Why

Just a small project to learn C, git hub specifics, and building things from scratch.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Thanks to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) for helping me get started with C , as this is my first C project.
